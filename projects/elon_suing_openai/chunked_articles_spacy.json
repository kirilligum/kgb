        "OpenAI countered that Mr Musk had previously backed the idea of a for-profit structure and even suggested a merger with his electric car firm Tesla.\n\n",
        "The feud intensified earlier this week after Apple unveiled a partnership with OpenAI to boost its Siri voice assistant and operating systems with OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot.\n\n",

        "The law, known as California Code of Civil Procedure 170.6, does not require the person issuing the challenge to provide any factual basis for their claim that the judge is prejudiced against them.",

        "The suit has been moving through the California court system in the months since, with Schulman ruling in late April that it should be designated a complex civil litigation – meaning that a single judge would hear the case rather than a jury.",
        "That designation makes Schulman’s disqualification even more consequential, since CBS News reports that he is one of only two judges in San Francisco currently assigned to hear complex cases.\n\n",
        "Musk’s suit alleges that Altman took the original mission of OpenAI to create a non-profit company that widely shared its technology with the public, and instead closed off its models and took investment deals with Microsoft that turned it into a largely for-profit entity currently valued at about $80bn.",
        "Altman and OpenAI have countered that there was no such “founding agreement” as Musk claims and accused him of professional jealousy over the company’s success since his departure.\n\n",
        "The California code on disqualifying judges is different than what might be cause for recusal at a federal level.",
        "There are a wide variety of reasons that a judge may disqualify themselves from legal proceedings, according to University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias.",
        "A judge or their family could have financial conflict, such as shares in a company, or there could be a personal or professional entanglement that would bias them in a case.",
        "If a judge expressed prejudice against a party in the case during another trial or in a public forum, that would also be grounds to disqualify.\n\n",
        "While California’s state law also allows for challenging a judge for causes similar to those at a state level, the code on disqualifications provides a much easier way to remove a judge in search of one that may be more favorable.\n\nMusk and Altman founded OpenAI together in 2015, but Musk left the company three years later amid an internal power struggle and disagreements over its direction.",
        "Musk has since launched his own rival artificial intelligence company, xAI.\n\n",

        "OpenAI describes itself as a “nonprofit” with a “goal [] to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole.”",
        "Musk’s complaint argues its operation of an artificial intelligence system (GPT-4) behind a paywall, plans to license future AI technology to Microsoft, and provision of a board observer seat to Microsoft betray this nonprofit mission.\n\n",
        "Musk’s claim may or may not be right.",
        "But he is surely the wrong person to bring it.",
        "The problem is it’s unclear whether anyone else will.\n\n",
        "Like OpenAI, nonprofit organizations often take corporate legal forms.",
        "This makes it easy for those steeped in for-profit corporate law to assume disgruntled donors or supporters can—like unhappy shareholders—sue to challenge the actions of their fiduciaries.",
        "They cannot.",
        "Standing to challenge nonprofit fiduciaries’ compliance with their duties is instead typically limited only to fellow fiduciaries and the state attorney general.",
        "Elon Musk is neither.\n\n",
        "He is, of course, a large donor.",
        "But once gifts have been made, donated assets are no longer donors’ property, and they lose the authority to sue to protect them.",
        "Unless a gift instrument provides for donor standing to challenge its use, typically donors must rely on a charity’s fiduciaries and the state attorney general for enforcement.",
        "Even contractual standing rights will not entitle donors to challenge a nonprofit’s compliance with its overall mission, as even substantial donations do not make donors the arbiter of a nonprofit’s purpose.\n\n",
        "Perhaps surprisingly, standing to sue nonprofit leaders is actually limited in order to protect their missions, which are myriad and sometimes divisive.",
        "Endowing contributors or the public at large with standing would subject controversial nonprofits to potentially draining nuisance suits.",
        "Competitors could use fiduciary challenges to wrest value from nonprofit entities to the ultimate detriment of their charitable missions.",
        "Filling the seats of nonprofit boards with dedicated and expert directors would become even more challenging.\n\n",
        "These well-intentioned standing limits make enforcement by the state attorney general all the more critical; but here, as too often, it may not be up to the task.",
        "OpenAI created an organizational structure designed to ensure its nonprofit mission remains paramount, but its directors’ and officers’ actions in commercializing its technology may have crossed the line.",
        "If so, attorney-general enforcement is appropriate and warranted.",

        "OpenAI’s 2018 charter declares that “[o]ur primary fiduciary duty is to humanity.”\n\n",
        "Musk’s claims for breach and false promises revolve around two central moves by OpenAI—the decision to partner with Microsoft allegedly undermining OpenAI’s public benefit, and the refusal to make public more information about its latest advances.\n\n",
        "This betrayal from the original mission, Musk argues, results in a breach of contract, a claim for promissory estoppel (promises made enforceable by law to avoid injustice), a breach of fiduciary duty, and constitutes unfair competition.\n\n",
        "The central difficulty for Musk is that the language of OpenAI’s commitments are, excuse the pun, open-ended.\n\n",
        "Musk notes that the 2015 Certificate of Incorporation requires OpenAI to “benefit the public.”",
        "However, Altman can certainly argue that the free public access to ChatGPT 3.5 evidences OpenAI’s public benefit.",
        "After all, millions of people across the world are using OpenAI’s free services.",
        "The founding documents do not commit OpenAI to benefit the public with every activity.",

        "Musk’s second complaint is about OpenAI’s lack of, as it were, openness.",
        "(Musk even suggested that if OpenAI changed its name to ClosedAI, he would drop the suit.)",
        "OpenAI has in fact become less and less open, providing less information about its AI models as they have advanced.",
        "OpenAI’s 2015 Certificate of Incorporation, however, only declared that “the corporation will seek to open source technology for the public benefit when applicable.”",
        "This loose commitment is not particularly demanding.",
        "Moreover, it is certainly plausible that Altman and OpenAI may have drawn the curtains around their most advanced technology in part to avoid that technology falling into the wrong hands.\n\n",
        "Musk faces a number of hurdles in his lawsuit, not least his own statements and actions during the course of his relationship with OpenAI.",
