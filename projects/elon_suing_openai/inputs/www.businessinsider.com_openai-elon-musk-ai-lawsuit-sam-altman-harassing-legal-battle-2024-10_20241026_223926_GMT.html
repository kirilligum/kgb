</div><div>Advertisement</div><p><a>OpenAI</a> has hit back at <a>Elon Musk</a> amid a legal fight between the startup and its estranged cofounder, accusing the billionaire of harassment. </p><p>In August, Musk <a>sued OpenAI for the second time this year</a>, arguing that executives at the AI company had "deceived" him into cofounding the lab by playing on his concerns about existential risks from AI.</p><p>The Tesla CEO's lawyers called <a>OpenAI's transition from a nonprofit </a>structure to a "capped-profit" structure a "textbook tale of altruism versus greed."</p><p>Musk cofounded OpenAI as a nonprofit AI lab in 2015 with CEO Sam Altman and <a>nine others</a>. He later resigned from the company's board of directors in 2018, a year before the company announced its for-profit arm.</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>In response to Musk's lawsuit, OpenAI called it the latest move in Musk's "increasingly blusterous campaign to harass OpenAI for his own competitive advantage."</p><p>"OpenAI is dedicated to the safe and beneficial development of artificial general intelligence ("AGI")," OpenAI's lawyers said in a court filing on Tuesday. "Musk once supported OpenAI in that mission but abandoned the venture when his bid to dominate it failed."</p><p>The filing added: "Since launching a competing artificial intelligence company, xAI, Musk has been trying to leverage the judicial system for an edge."</p><p>OpenAI asked for the case to be dismissed, arguing that Musk failed to offer factual or "legal scaffolding needed to sustain his claims."</p><div>Advertisement</div><p>Representatives for Musk and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, made outside normal working hours.</p><h2>A long-running feud</h2><p>In March, Musk first sued OpenAI on similar grounds but later dropped the suit in June.</p>
