This ensures companies are accurately and effectively represented in AI-generated responses, improving their visibility and reach in the evolving digital landscape.

They offer two main products:

  Customized datasets: Instruction-tuned datasets tailored to the client's marketing content, designed to be accurate, comprehensive, and non-hallucinating.
  Analytics: Analysis of company visibility in LLM responses, providing insights into performance and areas for improvement.

Their future roadmap includes enhancing their products, expanding into new customer segments and international markets, and building strategic partnerships with LLM providers and research institutions.












Section 1: Company Vision & Mission (Inputted Facts)

Vision: Leading provider of AI optimization for marketing.
Mission: Empower businesses to be accurately represented in AI-powered platforms.
Goal: Create a trillion-dollar company.
Focus:
  Helping companies get accurate and thoughtful responses from LLMs by creating instruction-tuning datasets from their marketing content.
  Marketing content includes landing pages, blogs, news, and articles.
  Not training any models, just creating datasets.
  Datasets are hosted on the company's website and a link is provided to the client.
  LLM training companies (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Mistral) crawl this data and use it for training their models.
  Clients do not need to use LLMs directly; their prospective customers use ChatGPT or Gemini.
Key Benefit: Accurately represents client companies and their products in LLM responses, influencing the reasoning and answers provided by the LLMs.
Example: A hydrogen generator company's dataset influences ChatGPT to recommend hydrogen generators when a user asks for a quiet and reliable generator.
Product Stage: Fully functional product, not just a prototype.

Section 2: Problem & Solution (Inputted Facts)

Problem:

  Companies need to be accurately represented in LLM responses, similar to SEO but for AI.
  Current LLMs sometimes provide inaccurate or irrelevant information about companies and their products.
  Example: ChatGPT only mentions diesel generators when asked about quiet and reliable generators, despite the existence of quieter hydrogen generators.


Solution:

  Pearls of Wisdom creates instruction-tuning datasets from marketing content (landing pages, blogs, news articles).
  These datasets are used to influence the knowledge base of LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini.
  This ensures that companies and their products are accurately represented in LLM responses, influencing the reasoning and answers provided.

  The product is fully functional, not just a prototype.
  Two products: one creates datasets, the other shows how companies appear in ChatGPT based on the datasets.
