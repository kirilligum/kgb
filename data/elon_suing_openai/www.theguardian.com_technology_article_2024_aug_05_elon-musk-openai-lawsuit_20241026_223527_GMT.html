The latest complaint “holds defendants accountable for intentional misrepresentations to Musk and the public, and seeks the disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains on a grand scale”, he said.</p><figure><gu-island><div><a><div><div>OpenAI’s Sam Altman is becoming one of the most powerful people on Earth.

The two co-founded OpenAI in 2015 before Musk left the company <a>over an internal power struggle</a> several years later. As Altman’s power grew, their relationship turned increasingly acrimonious.</p><p>Musk’s new lawsuit centers around a similar claim to the one he filed in February, arguing that Altman, his other co-founder Greg Brockman and OpenAI broke what he calls the “founding agreement” to develop artificial intelligence for the betterment of humanity. The company breached that agreement as it pivoted towards a partnership with Microsoft and became largely for-profit, Musk alleges, threatening humanity with reckless advancement of AI.</p><p>OpenAI and Altmanvehemently pushed back against Musk’s original allegations, casting him as a bitter and petty ex-partner who was jealous of the company’s success after he left. In a March blogpost following the initial suit, Altman and other OpenAI executives published emails claiming to show that Musk always supported a shift toward for-profit status and stated: “We’re sad that it’s come to this with someone whom we’ve deeply admired.”</p><p>“As we said about Elon’s initial legal filing, which was subsequently withdrawn, Elon’s prior emails continue to speak for themselves,” an OpenAI spokesperson told the Guardian in response to the new lawsuit.</p><p>The new complaint contains additional allegations that OpenAI broke federal racketeering laws, Musk’s lawyer <a>told the New York Times</a>, and is “a much more forceful lawsuit” than the previous dropped suit. It also alleges that Altman and his associates participated in “numerous acts of wire fraud” through accepting financial contributions from Musk.</p><figure><a>skip past newsletter promotion</a><aside><div><p>Sign up to <span>TechScape</span></p><div><span>Free weekly newsletter</span></div></div><p>A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives</p><span><strong>Privacy Notice: </strong>Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Musk’s chatbot has failed to gain the popularity or partnerships with big tech companies that ChatGPT has achieved, however, and faced backlash for spreading misinformation.</p><p>Five US secretaries of state announced on Monday that they <a>planned to send a letter to Musk</a> demanding changes to the chatbot after it promoted falsehoods about the 2024 presidential election.</p></div><div><span>Explore more on these topics</span><div><ul><li><a>OpenAI</a></li><li><a>Elon Musk</a></li><li><a>Artificial intelligence (AI)</a></li><li><a>Sam Altman</a></li><li><a>Computing</a></li><li><a>news</a></li></ul></div><div><gu-island><a>Share</a></gu-island><div><a>Reuse this content</a></div></div></div></div><div><section><gu-island><div><h3>Most viewed</h3><ul><li><div><a><div><h4><span>This mother made six attempts to raise the alarm about her sick toddler.
