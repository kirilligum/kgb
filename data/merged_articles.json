They’re selling you down the river.\"\n\nHowever, investors seemed to welcome the news, as Apple's stock market value rose to a record high above $3tn.\n\nMr Musk started his own AI company, called xAI, in July 2023, which he said would aim to \"understand reality\".\n\nIn November that year, xAI launched Grok, a chatbot with \"a little humour\", in a bid to rival the likes of ChatGPT."

            "body_text": "Elon Musk is reigniting a legal battle against OpenAI over its for-profit pivot, this time looking to void the company’s partnership with Microsoft.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of California on Monday, alleges fraud and breach of contract over claims that the Tesla founder was swindled when he invested roughly $45 million into the AI venture, which he says betrayed its original mission to safely develop the technology \"for the benefit of humanity.\" In Musk’s telling, chief executive Sam Altman illegally partnered with Microsoft to establish a web of illicit affiliates and plunder its nonprofit arm of assets and staff in violation of their deal.\n\nMusk seeks a court order invalidating OpenAI’s exclusive license with Microsoft giving it unique access to the underlying code of GPT-4, as well as treble damages and disgorgement of profits attributed to his investments in the company. It names Altman, president Greg Brockman and dozens of subsidiaries.\n\nIn Hollywood, utilization of AI tools in the production pipeline is positioned to be the next battleground between creators and studios. With the introduction of Sora, capable of creating hyperrealist videos with a prompt of just a couple sentences, OpenAI is courting the industry amid the rise of the technology.\n\nMarc Toberoff, a lawyer for Musk who regularly sues studios on behalf of creators to claw back the copyrights to their works, stresses that AI tools — if controlled by a handful of companies, like OpenAI and Microsoft — threatens talent. \"This case is about far more than money, the future of AGI lies in the balance,\" he says.\n\nAI is increasingly being adopted in concept art, visual effects and postproduction amid belt-tightening, displacing some workers.\n\nMusk’s ties to OpenAI can be traced back to 2015, when he cofounded the company among a group of other prominent Silicon Valley investors. The lawsuit points to messages from Altman as proof that he defrauded Musk, who was told in an email, \"The technology would be owned by the foundation and used ‘for the good of the world.'\"\n\nPer its certificate of incorporation, a legal document relating to the formation of a company, OpenAI said it \"will seek to open source technology for the public benefit.\" It adds that that company will \"not be organized for the private gain of any one person\" and that \"no part of the net income or assets of this corporation shall ever inure to the benefit of any director, officer or member.\"\n\nThe lawsuit details Microsoft’s early courtship of OpenAI while Musk was still with the company. In 2016, the Satya Nadella-led firm offered to sell \"Compute\" to the company at a steep discount if it’d agree to publicly promote Microsoft’s products, according to the complaint.\n\n\"This actually made me feel nauseous,\" he wrote to Altman, the lawsuit states. \"It sucks and is exactly what I would expect from them.\"\n\nLater that year, the two companies announced a partnership giving OpenAI access to Microsoft’s latest technology for running large-scale AI training.\n\nBut after he left the board in 2018 due to a potential conflict of interest with Tesla, which he owns and was ramping up its focus on AI, Musk claims Altman directed the company to form numerous for-profit entities. This includes OpenAI, L.P., which was established as a \"capped-profit company.\"\n\nAnd with the creation of a for-profit arm, Altman allegedly transferred the nonprofit division’s staff and assets to the new company. OpenAI’s dozens of other affiliates were woven into its \"corporate web for the purpose of profiting from the nonprofit’s assets\" as part of a \"shell game,\" the lawsuit says.\n\n\"Just follow the money,\" states the complaint. \"The nonprofit’s 2022 IRS tax return showed just $44,485.00 in revenue, but one year later, OpenAI overall reportedly generated hundreds of millions of dollars.\"\n\nMusk also alleges that Altman withheld and misrepresented information to the board, going as far as to lie in some business dealings. In discussions with the nonprofit, he allegedly claimed to be an independent board member of OpenAI Startup Fund while omitting that he owns the company. Other instances of alleged self-dealing include OpenAI’s partnership with Reddit in a deal in which the social media platform’s content can be shown on ChatGPT, as well as a $51 million chip deal with Rain, another company in which he’s a significant shareholder, according to the complaint.\n\n\"And currently, on information and belief, OpenAI is hammering out a deal with Helion Energy (in which Altman owns a massive stake) for [it] to buy vast quantities of electricity to power its data centers,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nOn \"The TED AI Show\" podcast, former OpenAI board member Helen Toner, who was a part of ousting Altman in November before he was reinstated, said: \"Sam had made it really difficult for the board to\" fulfill its mission to safely develop the technology by \"in some cases, outright lying.\" The lawsuit claims Musk seized control of the company’s board alongside Microsoft to further undermine safety guardrails, with the goal of maximizing profits.\n\nThe filing of the complaint follows Musk in June dropping a similar lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman without explanation. He’s openly criticized the company for abandoning its original structure.\n\nLast year, Musk founded xAI, which has since reached a valuation of $24 billion.\n\nMusk is represented by Toberoff, widely considered among the entertainment industry’s preeminent copyright termination lawyers. He’s brought lawsuits on behalf of the estate of Steve Ditko, who co-created Spider-Man and Doctor Strange, the heirs to the writer of the magazine story that spawned Top Gun and Lance Hill, who wrote the screenplay for Road House."

            "body_text": "Topline\n\nElon Musk on Monday revived a lawsuit against OpenAI and its founder Sam Altman, claiming the company has prioritized the development of artificial intelligence for profit instead of the benefit of humanity, weeks after Tesla’s chief executive withdrew his original suit and revitalizing a yearslong feud between Musk and the company.\n\nMusk withdrew an original lawsuit earlier this year, after claiming OpenAI and its founders were developing AI to “maximize profits” instead of benefiting humanity.\n\nKey Facts\n\nIn the new complaint, Musk alleges OpenAI, Altman and co-founder Greg Brockman breached OpenAI’s founding contract from 2015 by developing AI for “personal profits,” claiming Altman “stands to make billions” from the company, instead of for the “benefit of humanity.”\n\nMusk filed a similar lawsuit in February but withdrew the suit in June, a day before a judge was scheduled to rule on whether it should be dismissed, though Musk did not explain his decision to back out.\n\nAltman and Brockman approached Musk—who later agreed to help fund the project—in 2015 to launch a non-profit organization to develop AI for the public good, a mission that Musk alleges the company and its founders have failed by partnering with Microsoft, according to the latest filing.\n\nMusk’s lawsuit requests a jury trial and for OpenAI to pay damages that would be determined at that trial, and for a judge to fully or partially nullify OpenAI’s licensing agreement with Microsoft.\n\nOpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nContra\n\nOpenAI responded to Musk’s original lawsuit in a blog post, saying the company’s mission is to ensure AI “benefits all of humanity, which means both building safe and beneficial” technology and “helping create broadly distributed benefits.”\n\nKey Background\n\nMusk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and its founders in March, stemming from claims Musk said the company made when helping secure funding from him. OpenAI, founded as a non-profit in 2015, allegedly promised to have its technology be open-sourced to the public while also developing guardrails for AI, Musk said. OpenAI launched its for-profit arm in 2019, which it said would “rapidly increase our investments” to help ensure AI “benefits all of humanity.” Musk stepped away from OpenAI in 2018, though his filing indicates he continued contributing financially up to late 2020. OpenAI said Musk acknowledged the company’s need for a for-profit arm to help secure funding, despite his criticism, while also claiming in 2017 that Musk wanted to have a majority equity in the company’s for-profit arm and be its CEO. Musk has criticized OpenAI’s relationship with Microsoft for years, alleging the company has prioritized profits and shareholder value over AI safety. In his original filing, Musk alleged Microsoft “stands to make a fortune” from selling GPT-4, the company’s AI model, which would “not be possible” if OpenAI made its technology available and free to the public “as it is required to do so.”\n\nForbes Valuation\n\nMusk is the richest person in the world with a net worth of $226.9 billion, according to our latest estimates.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nElon Musk Drops Breach Of Contract Lawsuit Against OpenAI\n\nBy Antonio Pequeño IV"

            "author": "Nick Robins-Early",
            "publisher": "The Guardian",
            "body_text": "Challenge cited California state law that allows plaintiffs and defendants to remove judge they believe can’t grant impartial trial\n\nThe California judge presiding over Elon Musk’s lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, has removed himself from the case. Judge Ethan Schulman on Monday sustained a challenge from Musk’s lawyers, which cited a California state law that allows plaintiffs and defendants to remove a judge they believe cannot grant an impartial trial.\n\nThe law, known as California Code of Civil Procedure 170.6, does not require the person issuing the challenge to provide any factual basis for their claim that the judge is prejudiced against them. Each side in a case gets one such peremptory challenge, which is granted as long as it is filed with correct language and within a certain time frame.\n\nLawyers for Altman and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe judge’s disqualification is the latest turn for the controversial case, which is already based on fairly untested legal arguments and pits two of the most influential men in tech against each other. In March, Musk filed suit against Altman, his former OpenAI co-founder, alleging that the ChatGPT maker had breached a “founding agreement” to work for the betterment of humanity and instead pursued private commercial success.\n\nThe suit has been moving through the California court system in the months since, with Schulman ruling in late April that it should be designated a complex civil litigation – meaning that a single judge would hear the case rather than a jury. That designation makes Schulman’s disqualification even more consequential, since CBS News reports that he is one of only two judges in San Francisco currently assigned to hear complex cases.\n\nMusk’s suit alleges that Altman took the original mission of OpenAI to create a non-profit company that widely shared its technology with the public, and instead closed off its models and took investment deals with Microsoft that turned it into a largely for-profit entity currently valued at about $80bn. Altman and OpenAI have countered that there was no such “founding agreement” as Musk claims and accused him of professional jealousy over the company’s success since his departure.\n\nThe California code on disqualifying judges is different than what might be cause for recusal at a federal level. There are a wide variety of reasons that a judge may disqualify themselves from legal proceedings, according to University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias. A judge or their family could have financial conflict, such as shares in a company, or there could be a personal or professional entanglement that would bias them in a case. If a judge expressed prejudice against a party in the case during another trial or in a public forum, that would also be grounds to disqualify.\n\nWhile California’s state law also allows for challenging a judge for causes similar to those at a state level, the code on disqualifications provides a much easier way to remove a judge in search of one that may be more favorable.\n\nMusk and Altman founded OpenAI together in 2015, but Musk left the company three years later amid an internal power struggle and disagreements over its direction. Musk has since launched his own rival artificial intelligence company, xAI.\n\nThe case is now set to be reassigned to a new judge, and previous dates scheduled for it have been vacated."

            "body_text": "Elon Musk and Sam Altman in happier times—at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on Oct. 6, 2015, in San Francisco.\nMichael Kovac—Getty Images for Vanity Fair\n\nElon Musk’s chances of winning his second lawsuit against OpenAI look grim, but in law nothing is entirely hopeless.\n\nThe entrepreneur has claimed the nonprofit he helped found cannot legally convert to a corporation without violating the very purpose for which it was created nine years ago—to benefit humanity as a whole by developing the world’s first artificial general intelligence (AGI).\n\nMusk is seeking to force his former creation to compensate him for treble the $44.6 million he donated over five years and compel it to open-source all the research findings behind its neural network GPT-4. \n\nThe latter coincidentally would also serve the interests of his own xAI research lab, a direct competitor to OpenAI.\n\nYet U.S. law isn’t kind to private litigants like Musk seeking redress against charitable nonprofits to which they have made tax-deductible donations. Attempts made after the fact to demand money back or insist funds be used differently are typically doomed.\n\n“All those cases fail,” Brian Quinn, a professor of corporate law at Boston College Law School, tells Fortune. “There’s very little legal basis for those kinds of claims. Once the money is handed over, that’s it.”\n\nThrowing legal spaghetti at the wall\n\nWhile nonprofits need to be mindful of how they treat donors if they want the checks to keep flowing, they have no shareholders with an economic interest that can be damaged. \n\nLegally speaking, the responsibility to litigate on behalf of the public falls to the authorities—typically the attorney general of a state.\n\n“If you donate to a charity, you don’t have a lot of recourse to later sue. U.S. law is not very favorable to donors in that regard,” Luís Calderón Gómez, a tax law specialist and assistant professor at Yeshiva University’s Cardozo Law School, tells Fortune.\n\nHe believes Musk’s chances may improve now that his team has shifted its legal strategy, increasing the number of alleged offenses to 14 from just four—even if the crux of the matter hasn’t changed.\n\nAccusing OpenAI of everything from fraud and racketeering to false advertising and unjust enrichment may look like the legal equivalent of throwing spaghetti at a wall, hoping one of the charges somehow sticks.  \n\nYet Calderón Gómez believes his case isn’t entirely without merit, given that courts may not look kindly on OpenAI’s brazen shedding of its nonprofit shell.\n\nMusk has alleged the existence of a “Founding Agreement,” arranged with CEO Sam Altman, that expressly prohibits this eventuality. He has, however, failed to produce it, arguing instead it was reflected in the nonprofit’s December 2015 certificate of incorporation sufficiently to prove his point.\n\nOpenAI moves to dismiss Musk lawsuit\n\n“If he had that [Founding Agreement], he’d have a very strong case,” says Calderón Gómez. He believes Musk would be better off framing his dealings less as a donor and more as a cofounder who signed a binding document.\n\nThe burden of proof, however, lies with Musk—and demonstrating that OpenAI had planned to defraud him at the time of its founding will be challenging in the absence of clear evidence.\n\nListing no less than 82 separate legal precedents to back up their argument, lawyers for Altman’s company argued on Wednesday that Musk didn’t have a leg on which to stand.\n\n“What’s new is that the carcass of the ‘Founding Agreement’ (now lowercased and shunted to the back of the complaint) is larded with allegations of fraud, racketeering, and false advertising,” OpenAI’s lawyers wrote dismissively. “But Musk offers neither the factual nor the legal scaffolding needed to sustain his claims.”\n\nOpenAI’s legal team moved this week to dismiss the lawsuit outright, claiming Musk’s second attempt to drag the ChatGPT creator to court was just dressed up in even more hysterical language to deflect from its lack of substance.\n\nMusk’s legal team at Toberoff & Associates didn’t respond to a request from Fortune for comment.\n\nOpenAI is among the most valuable privately held companies\n\nOpenAI has been increasingly candid about its plans to become a normal for-profit corporation, telling staff this will likely happen sometime next year.  \n\nAt present, the company has no profits to distribute, and in fact it continues to lose money owing to the exorbitant costs of training and refining its models; by last account, $5 billion in red ink is expected for this year. \n\nMoreover, a string of high-profile exits have occurred over the past six months, leaving CEO Sam Altman as one of only three founding team members left.  \n\nThat hasn’t stopped investors from falling over themselves to buy shares in its operating company, which is titularly controlled by the nonprofit. Despite profits being capped, the equity it just raised valued it at $157 billion, making OpenAI one of the most valuable privately owned companies in the world. \n\nMusk turns against his own creation\n\nMusk, who left the board in 2018 and stopped donating entirely two years later, has meanwhile been forced to watch the success from the sidelines—a success he no longer could claim as his own.\n\nInitially he still seemed like the proud parent. Days after ChatGPT launched at the end of 2022, he used his social media platform to draw attention to the invention and even chastised the New York Times twice for failing to cover it.  \n\nIn subsequent months, however, his tone changed dramatically as OpenAI grabbed headlines and triggered an explosion of interest in AI.\n\nAfter it was clear ChatGPT would soon become the fastest-growing app in history, Musk began to speak out publicly against Altman’s research outfit, saying it had become the exact opposite of what he intended.\n\nBy May of 2023, it was clear he had an axe to grind.\n\n‘I am the reason OpenAI exists’\n\nThat month, Musk told CNBC he had effectively wound up donating to a charity “to save the Amazon rainforest, and instead they became a lumber company, and chopped down the forest and sold it for money.”  \n\nAt the time Musk was frustrated investors weren’t rewarding Tesla’s stock price for its own AI endeavors. He felt viewers ought to know Tesla was also on the cusp of its own ChatGPT moment once his Teslas could drive themselves without human supervision, a feat he qualified as “baby AGI.”  \n\nMusk wasn’t about to let OpenAI take all the credit two years after it cashed his last donation. “I am the reason OpenAI exists,” he said in the interview. By then Musk had already revealed plans to launch his own OpenAI competitor, xAI, an idea that would eventually become a reality that July.\n\nEmails reveal Musk wanted to seize control\n\nIn February this year, Musk finally sued the company, claiming it had broken its word to remain a nonprofit.\n\nShortly thereafter, OpenAI produced evidence showing Musk was well aware of this likelihood in late 2017, supported it himself, and only broke with the organization after he was not allowed to run it as CEO or subsume it into Tesla.\n\n“Elon wanted majority equity, initial board control, and to be CEO,” the company revealed, sharing emails exchanged at the time. “We couldn’t agree to terms on a for-profit with Elon, because we felt it was against the mission for any individual to have absolute control over OpenAI. He then suggested instead merging OpenAI into Tesla.”\n\nExactly one day before OpenAI’s scheduled hearing over its first motion to dismiss, the law firm Irell & Manella, which represented Musk at the time, informed California’s Superior Court that it was withdrawing the lawsuit—with no explanation given.\n\nMusk filed a second lawsuit in August, but nothing that OpenAI has seen has since changed its mind. “Elon’s recycled complaint is without merit, and his prior emails continue to speak for themselves,” OpenAI told Fortune in a statement.\n\nCourts likely won’t indulge a legal fishing expedition\n\nBoston College Law School’s Quinn argues the Amazon rainforest analogy doesn’t constitute fraud, so long as Altman wasn’t actively shopping for chain saws at the time. Transforming into a logging company several years after Musk was already out the door may be a morally questionable decision, but it isn’t an illegal one.\n\nBarring a minor miracle, Quinn expects Musk’s case to be thrown out at the first opportunity. Musk might refile again since he has an effectively infinite ability to keep funding lawsuits, but eventually, a judge would sanction him.\n\n“If there is no factual basis for the allegations, the court is not going to open its doors to say, ‘Anyone who wants to sue anyone else, just come on down here, put some words on paper, we’ll place unnecessary costs on defendants just for you to engage in a fishing expedition to come up with some damaging stuff,’” Quinn says. “Courts are for good reason generally unwilling to allow plaintiffs to bootstrap lawsuits.”\n\nPotential California lawsuit seen as having better odds\n\nMusk can, however, take heart in knowing that at least one consumer advocacy group shares his frustration, even if for reasons other than personal ones.\n\nThe nonpartisan, Washington, D.C.-based Public Citizen has filed a complaint against Altman’s company with California Attorney General Rob Bonta over its for-profit transformation.\n\nCopresident Robert Weissman wrote the state AG “should insist that an OpenAI conversion to for-profit status reserve for humanity the right to any OpenAI invention of ‘artificial general intelligence.’” \n\nIn addition, Public Citizen wants OpenAI to pay roughly equivalent the value extracted from the nonprofit and handed to shareholders—to endow a new independent foundation for AI safety.\n\nThat alone should cost the new for-profit tens of billions of dollars, it estimates, something that could serve as consolation to Musk.\n\nWhen reached by Fortune, Bonta’s office wouldn’t say whether this has resulted in any enforcement action. “To protect the integrity of our investigations, we’re unable to comment on, even to confirm or deny, a potential or ongoing investigation,” it said.\n\nYeshiva University’s Calderón Gómez believes a state-launched case would have a far better outlook for success than Musk’s private lawsuit.\n\n“If I were in the California AG’s office, I would probably sue,” he says. “There’s enough facts here that make me believe this hasn’t been operated as a nonprofit for a while now."

He later resigned from the company's board of directors in 2018, a year before the company announced its for-profit arm.\n\nIn response to Musk's lawsuit, OpenAI called it the latest move in Musk's \"increasingly blusterous campaign to harass OpenAI for his own competitive advantage.\"\n\n\"OpenAI is dedicated to the safe and beneficial development of artificial general intelligence (\"AGI\"),\" OpenAI's lawyers said in a court filing on Tuesday. \"Musk once supported OpenAI in that mission but abandoned the venture when his bid to dominate it failed.\"\n\nThe filing added: \"Since launching a competing artificial intelligence company, xAI, Musk has been trying to leverage the judicial system for an edge.\"\n\nOpenAI asked for the case to be dismissed, arguing that Musk failed to offer factual or \"legal scaffolding needed to sustain his claims.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Musk and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider, made outside normal working hours.\n\nA long-running feud\n\nIn March, Musk first sued OpenAI on similar grounds but later dropped the suit in June.\n\nThe billionaire has publicly criticized OpenAI's fundraising and products sold through its for-profit arm, sharing memes and critical posts about the AI company via his social media platform, X.\n\nHe's also criticized the company's close partnership with Microsoft and OpenAI's flagship product, ChatGPT.\n\nMusk also took issue with OpenAI's recent historic funding round.\n\nIn October, OpenAI completed a funding round of $6.6 billion, valuing it at $157 billion, making it one of the most valuable startups in the world. Musk later weighed in on the funding round in a post on X, sharing a report that OpenAI had asked investors for an exclusive funding agreement in which they would refrain from backing five of its competitors and calling the company \"evil.\"\n\nMusk's xAI was reportedly among the list of five competitors, along with Perplexity, Glean, Anthropic, and Ilya Sutskever's Safe Superintelligence.\n\nOpenAI is reportedly moving further away from its nonprofit roots with plans to restructure to become a for-profit benefit corporation.\n\nIt's the latest development during a tumultuous period for the company that has seen several key executives part ways, including prominent figures like Mira Muta, the company's former CTO, and cofounder Ilya Sutskever.\n\n"

            "body_text": "Elon Musk has sued OpenAI for allegedly misleading him about the goals of its artificial intelligence development efforts.\nThe lawsuit was filed today with the District Court for the Northern District of California. Musk’s attorneys name not only OpenAI but also Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, the AI developer’s chief executive and president, respectively, as defendants. The lawsuit is similar to a case that Musk brought against the company in March and withdrew a few months later without providing a reason.\nOpenAI launched as a nonprofit in 2015 with backing from Musk and several other technology executives. In 2019, it created a for-profit arm to lead its AI development projects. Over the subsequent years, OpenAI received more than $10 billion worth of funding and cloud infrastructure from Microsoft Corp., which in turn gained an exclusive license to the AI developer’s large language models.\nMusk’s new lawsuit accuses OpenAI, Altman and Brockman of misleading him when the AI developer was founded in 2015. At the time, OpenAI allegedly positioned itself as a nonprofit committed to making its AI technology available under an open-source license. The lawsuit argues that the company’s launch of its for-profit arm and its subsequent partnership with Microsoft breached this commitment.\n“After Musk lent his name to the venture, invested significant time, tens of millions of dollars in seed capital, and recruited top Al scientists for OpenAL Inc., Musk and the non-profit’s namesake objective were betrayed by Altman and his accomplices,” the lawsuit reads.\nMusk is seeking damages from OpenAI for alleged breach of contract, false advertising and unfair competition. Furthermore, the lawsuit asks the court to either void the AI developer’s LLM licensing agreement with Microsoft or determine whether its newest LLMs qualify as artificial general intelligence. OpenAI’s licensing agreement with Microsoft doesn’t cover AGI, which means that the latter company would lose access to GPT-4o if the model were to be designated as AGI by the court.\nAfter Musk filed his first, since-withdrawn lawsuit against OpenAI in March, the company published a set of partly redacted emails from the Tesla Inc. CEO. In one of the messages, Musk seemed to support the idea that the company should adopt a for-profit approach. “A for-profit pivot might create a more sustainable revenue stream over time and would, with the current team, likely bring in a lot of investment,” Musk wrote.\n“As we said about Elon’s initial legal filing, which was subsequently withdrawn, Elon’s prior emails continue to speak for themselves,” an OpenAI spokesperson told Axios.\nThe lawsuit comes about two months after Musk’s xAI Corp., an AI startup that competes with OpenAI, raised $6 billion in funding at a $24 billion valuation. The company develops an LLM series called Grok with a similar set of capabilities as GPT-4o. The funding will help xAI upgrade its AI development infrastructure, which includes a supercomputer that is expected to feature 100,000 graphics cards once it becomes fully operational."

            "body_text": "Tesla CEO alleges his former partners, including CEO Sam Altman, manipulated him into co-founding the company\n\nElon Musk is once again suing OpenAI and its chief executive, Sam Altman, resurrecting a legal battle against his former partners with a case that now claims they manipulated him into co-founding the artificial intelligence company.\n\nMonths after abruptly withdrawing a similar lawsuit without explanation, Musk filed a new lawsuit on Monday in a northern California federal court.\n\nOpenAI denied the allegations in a statement to the Guardian, pointing to its previous blogposts about Musk’s initial lawsuit earlier this year.\n\nMusk’s latest complaint claims the case is a “textbook tale of altruism versus greed”, repeating allegations in his previous suit that his former co-founders in OpenAI betrayed him by turning the company from a non-profit into a largely for-profit enterprise. “The perfidy and deceit is of Shakespearean proportions,” it states.\n\nMusk’s lawyer, Marc Toberoff, claimed the new lawsuit held vast differences from the case earlier this year. The latest complaint “holds defendants accountable for intentional misrepresentations to Musk and the public, and seeks the disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains on a grand scale”, he said.\n\nThe lawsuit renews a legal battle between Musk, the world’s richest man and one of its most influential tech leaders, and Altman, who has become the face of the generative AI boom in recent years and a prominent industry figure himself. The two co-founded OpenAI in 2015 before Musk left the company over an internal power struggle several years later. As Altman’s power grew, their relationship turned increasingly acrimonious.\n\nMusk’s new lawsuit centers around a similar claim to the one he filed in February, arguing that Altman, his other co-founder Greg Brockman and OpenAI broke what he calls the “founding agreement” to develop artificial intelligence for the betterment of humanity. The company breached that agreement as it pivoted towards a partnership with Microsoft and became largely for-profit, Musk alleges, threatening humanity with reckless advancement of AI.\n\nOpenAI and Altman vehemently pushed back against Musk’s original allegations, casting him as a bitter and petty ex-partner who was jealous of the company’s success after he left. In a March blogpost following the initial suit, Altman and other OpenAI executives published emails claiming to show that Musk always supported a shift toward for-profit status and stated: “We’re sad that it’s come to this with someone whom we’ve deeply admired.”\n\n“As we said about Elon’s initial legal filing, which was subsequently withdrawn, Elon’s prior emails continue to speak for themselves,” an OpenAI spokesperson told the Guardian in response to the new lawsuit.\n\nThe new complaint contains additional allegations that OpenAI broke federal racketeering laws, Musk’s lawyer told the New York Times, and is “a much more forceful lawsuit” than the previous dropped suit. It also alleges that Altman and his associates participated in “numerous acts of wire fraud” through accepting financial contributions from Musk.\n\n“​​After Musk lent his name to the venture, invested significant time, tens of millions of dollars in seed capital and recruited top AI scientists for OpenAI Inc, Musk and the non-profit’s namesake objective were betrayed by Altman and his accomplices,” the suit states.\n\nMusk’s original case against Altman and OpenAI wound through California courts for weeks and included his lawyers successfully petitioning for a change of judge, but they pulled the suit without comment one day before a San Francisco superior court judge was set to hear Altman and OpenAI’s case for dismissal.\n\nMusk also founded his own rival AI company last year, called xAI, and has pursued building a similar chatbot to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Musk’s chatbot has failed to gain the popularity or partnerships with big tech companies that ChatGPT has achieved, however, and faced backlash for spreading misinformation.\n\nFive US secretaries of state announced on Monday that they planned to send a letter to Musk demanding changes to the chatbot after it promoted falsehoods about the 2024 presidential election."

            "body_text": "Two professors of law assess the merits and questions raised by Musk’s recent lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman.\n\nElon Musk is suing OpenAI and its directors for, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty. The alleged breach consists essentially of allowing the use of OpenAI’s assets (including funds donated by Musk) for pursuit of private, for-profit purposes rather than the charitable nonprofit ones for which OpenAI was founded. OpenAI describes itself as a “nonprofit” with a “goal [] to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole.” Musk’s complaint argues its operation of an artificial intelligence system (GPT-4) behind a paywall, plans to license future AI technology to Microsoft, and provision of a board observer seat to Microsoft betray this nonprofit mission.\n\nMusk’s claim may or may not be right. But he is surely the wrong person to bring it. The problem is it’s unclear whether anyone else will.\n\nLike OpenAI, nonprofit organizations often take corporate legal forms. This makes it easy for those steeped in for-profit corporate law to assume disgruntled donors or supporters can—like unhappy shareholders—sue to challenge the actions of their fiduciaries. They cannot. Standing to challenge nonprofit fiduciaries’ compliance with their duties is instead typically limited only to fellow fiduciaries and the state attorney general. Elon Musk is neither.\n\nHe is, of course, a large donor. But once gifts have been made, donated assets are no longer donors’ property, and they lose the authority to sue to protect them. Unless a gift instrument provides for donor standing to challenge its use, typically donors must rely on a charity’s fiduciaries and the state attorney general for enforcement. Even contractual standing rights will not entitle donors to challenge a nonprofit’s compliance with its overall mission, as even substantial donations do not make donors the arbiter of a nonprofit’s purpose.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, standing to sue nonprofit leaders is actually limited in order to protect their missions, which are myriad and sometimes divisive. Endowing contributors or the public at large with standing would subject controversial nonprofits to potentially draining nuisance suits. Competitors could use fiduciary challenges to wrest value from nonprofit entities to the ultimate detriment of their charitable missions. Filling the seats of nonprofit boards with dedicated and expert directors would become even more challenging.\n\nThese well-intentioned standing limits make enforcement by the state attorney general all the more critical; but here, as too often, it may not be up to the task. OpenAI created an organizational structure designed to ensure its nonprofit mission remains paramount, but its directors’ and officers’ actions in commercializing its technology may have crossed the line. If so, attorney-general enforcement is appropriate and warranted. But attorneys general are notoriously underresourced and this suit would take on a massive and contentious industry with the potential to infuriate multiple tech billionaires. Will even an attorney general with grave concerns choose to absorb the litigation costs and political fallout from a suit against OpenAI’s leaders? This potential vacuum – even when billions in charitable assets are at risk – reveals afresh the risks of underenforcement in the nonprofit sector and the need for creative solutions.\n\nAccording to Elon Musk, the fate of humanity may depend on the resolution of his lawsuit, filed earlier in March, against Sam Altman and the company Altman co-founded and runs, OpenAI. Musk claims the lawsuit is designed to ensure that artificial intelligence benefits humanity, rather than becoming “super-intelligent, surpass[ing] human intelligence, and threaten[ing] humanity.”\n\nMusk argues that Altman and OpenAI betrayed OpenAI’s founding raison d’etre to be the anti-Google, or “the opposite of Google,” as Musk’s complaint describes. OpenAI’s technology would benefit humanity, rather than benefitting a few rich people. OpenAI’s 2018 charter declares that “[o]ur primary fiduciary duty is to humanity.”\n\nMusk’s claims for breach and false promises revolve around two central moves by OpenAI—the decision to partner with Microsoft allegedly undermining OpenAI’s public benefit, and the refusal to make public more information about its latest advances.\n\nThis betrayal from the original mission, Musk argues, results in a breach of contract, a claim for promissory estoppel (promises made enforceable by law to avoid injustice), a breach of fiduciary duty, and constitutes unfair competition.\n\nThe central difficulty for Musk is that the language of OpenAI’s commitments are, excuse the pun, open-ended.\n\nMusk notes that the 2015 Certificate of Incorporation requires OpenAI to “benefit the public.” However, Altman can certainly argue that the free public access to ChatGPT 3.5 evidences OpenAI’s public benefit. After all, millions of people across the world are using OpenAI’s free services. The founding documents do not commit OpenAI to benefit the public with every activity. Even a not-for-profit can sell goods or services in order to raise funds for its operations. Unless Musk or some other benefactor had been willing to give orders of magnitude more funds to OpenAI, its efforts to advance AI would need another funding source. Its deal with Microsoft is seen as providing crucial advantages to both companies—for OpenAI, the computing resources to develop its models, and for Microsoft, access to advanced AI models that it could use in future products.\n\nMusk’s second complaint is about OpenAI’s lack of, as it were, openness. (Musk even suggested that if OpenAI changed its name to ClosedAI, he would drop the suit.) OpenAI has in fact become less and less open, providing less information about its AI models as they have advanced. OpenAI’s 2015 Certificate of Incorporation, however, only declared that “the corporation will seek to open source technology for the public benefit when applicable.” This loose commitment is not particularly demanding. Moreover, it is certainly plausible that Altman and OpenAI may have drawn the curtains around their most advanced technology in part to avoid that technology falling into the wrong hands.\n\nMusk faces a number of hurdles in his lawsuit, not least his own statements and actions during the course of his relationship with OpenAI. But the central premise of his lawsuit is itself fairly weak.\n\nHumanity’s fate will likely not be decided with this suit.\n\nArticles represent the opinions of their writers, not necessarily those of the University of Chicago, the Booth School of Business, or its faculty."

            "body_text": "<p>Elon Musk filed a <a>new federal lawsuit</a> against OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman today, accusing the artificial intelligence company of abandoning its founding mission to benefit humanity in favor of pursuing profits.</p>\n<p>The 83-page complaint, lodged in the <a>U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California</a>, revives and expands upon allegations Musk first raised in a state court lawsuit earlier this year.</p>\n<div><span>Are you ready for AI agents?</span></div><p>“Elon Musk’s case against Sam Altman and OpenAI is a textbook tale of altruism versus greed,” the <a>lawsuit states</a>, setting the stage for what could be a landmark battle over the future of artificial intelligence development.</p>\n<h2>The siren song of Silicon Valley: Promises made, promises broken</h2>\n<p>Musk, who <a>co-founded OpenAI</a> as a non-profit in 2015 before <a>departing in 2018</a>, claims Altman and other company leaders “intentionally courted and deceived” him, exploiting his concerns about the existential risks posed by advanced AI.</p>\n<p>The complaint alleges that once OpenAI’s technology approached transformative artificial general intelligence (AGI), “Altman flipped the narrative and proceeded to cash in.”</p>\n<p>“The perfidy and deceit are of Shakespearean proportions,” the lawsuit declares, employing unusually dramatic language for a legal filing.</p>\n<p>At the core of Musk’s argument lies the assertion that <a>OpenAI’s partnership with Microsoft</a> and shift towards a more commercial model violates the company’s founding principles. The lawsuit contends that “In partnership with Microsoft, Altman established an opaque web of for-profit OpenAI affiliates, engaged in rampant self-dealing, seized OpenAI Inc.’s Board, and systematically drained the non-profit of its valuable technology and personnel.”</p>\n<p>This latest legal salvo comes just months after Musk unexpectedly <a>withdrew a similar lawsuit</a> against OpenAI in California state court. The new complaint introduces additional claims, including accusations that OpenAI engaged in racketeering activity.</p>\n<h2>From utopian dreams to corporate schemes: The OpenAI saga unfolds</h2>\n<p>OpenAI has previously dismissed Musk’s allegations as “<a>frivolous</a>” and <a>released emails</a> suggesting Musk acknowledged early on that the company would need to generate substantial profits to fund its AI research. The company did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the new lawsuit.</p>\n<p>This legal battle exemplifies the fundamental tension at the heart of AI development: the need for vast resources to push the boundaries of technology versus the ethical imperative to ensure AI benefits humanity as a whole. OpenAI’s evolution from a non-profit to a <a>“capped-profit” model</a> highlights the challenges of maintaining idealistic goals in the face of financial realities and competitive pressures in the AI industry.</p>\n<p>The case also underscores the complex interplay between private enterprise and public interest in emerging technologies. As AI systems become increasingly powerful and pervasive, questions of governance, accountability, and ethical development are moving from abstract debates to concrete legal and policy challenges. Musk’s lawsuit may serve as a catalyst for broader discussions about the appropriate structures and incentives for responsible AI development.</p>\n<p>The case emerges amid increasing <a>regulatory scrutiny of OpenAI</a>. The Federal Trade Commission is <a>investigating the company</a> for potential consumer protection violations, while several prominent AI safety researchers have recently departed OpenAI, citing concerns about the prioritization of rapid product releases over safety considerations.</p>\n<p>Musk’s lawsuit seeks to invalidate OpenAI’s <a>licensing agreement with Microsoft</a> and establish a constructive trust over assets allegedly derived from Musk’s contributions to the company. Legal experts suggest the case faces significant hurdles but could have far-reaching implications for AI governance.</p>\n<h2>Titans clash in the digital colosseum: The battle for AI’s soul</h2>\n<p>The outcome of this case could set important precedents for how courts interpret the obligations of AI companies to their stated missions and early backers. It may also influence future structures for AI research organizations, potentially encouraging more robust safeguards against mission drift or clearer delineations between non-profit and for-profit activities in the field.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the lawsuit shines a spotlight on the <a>concentration of power in AI development</a>. The involvement of tech giants like Microsoft in ostensibly independent AI research raises questions about market competition, innovation, and the long-term implications of AI capabilities being controlled by a small number of powerful entities.</p>\n<p>As the legal drama unfolds, it promises to offer new insights into OpenAI’s early days and the competing visions for artificial intelligence that continue to shape one of the most consequential technological developments of our time. With billions of dollars and potentially the future of AGI at stake, Musk’s lawsuit ensures that the controversy surrounding OpenAI will remain at the forefront of tech industry discourse for the foreseeable future.</p>"

Musk states in the latest lawsuit, filed in a district court in Northern California, that he was “manipulated” into co-founding OpenAI by Altman and Brockman, who allegedly promised “that it would chart a safer, more open course than profit-driven tech giants.”\n\n“Altman assured Musk that the non-profit structure guaranteed neutrality and a focus on safety and openness for the benefit of humanity, not shareholder value. But as it turns out, this was all hot-air philanthropy—the hook for Altman’s long con,” the lawsuit claims.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson pointed CNBC to a blog post after Musk’s initial lawsuit in March.\n\n“As we said about Elon’s initial legal filing, which was subsequently withdrawn, Elon’s prior emails continue to speak for themselves,” the spokesperson said.\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment on this story. Tesla did not respond to CNBC’s request for comment.\n\nIdentifying OpenAI as a nonprofit with no shareholders, the lawsuit states that Microsoft “sought to obtain leverage in other ways by, for example, enticing OpenAI, Inc. to use and become inextricably dependent on Microsoft’s cloud computing system.”\n\n“While Musk expressed a liking for Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella … the values of the company and OpenAI, Inc. did not align,” the lawsuit claims.\n\nMicrosoft is the biggest investor in OpenAI and has poured a reported $13 billion into the company.\n\n“Over the course of the next few years and continuing to today, Microsoft methodically entrenched itself further into OpenAI,” the lawsuit alleges.\n\n— CNBC’s Jordan Novet contributed to this report."

The lawsuit accuses OpenAI of fraud and breach of contract, among other allegations. The lawsuit casts Musk, one of the world’s richest people, as a victim of a complex scam whereby he agreed to donate $44 million of his own money, after which OpenAI, he claims, violated its non-profit mission. Musk left OpenAI in 2018 after attempting to take over the company.\n\nIn June, Musk withdrew this suit against Altman for unknown reasons, but the new filing includes federal racketeering allegations against Altman and co-founder Greg Brockman. OpenAI said that Musk has understood OpenAI’s mission and direction from the beginning, and that his donation was not coerced.\n\nMusk now runs xAI, a company he hopes will rival OpenAI, and has AI interests with his automotive company Tesla. So, some may question whether Musk truly feels wronged or just wants to stick it to his former colleagues."
