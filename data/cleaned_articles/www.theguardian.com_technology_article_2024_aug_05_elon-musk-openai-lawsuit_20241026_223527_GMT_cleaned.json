    "body_text": "Tesla CEO alleges his former partners, including CEO Sam Altman, manipulated him into co-founding the company\n\nElon Musk is once again suing OpenAI and its chief executive, Sam Altman, resurrecting a legal battle against his former partners with a case that now claims they manipulated him into co-founding the artificial intelligence company.\n\nMonths after abruptly withdrawing a similar lawsuit without explanation, Musk filed a new lawsuit on Monday in a northern California federal court.\n\nOpenAI denied the allegations in a statement to the Guardian, pointing to its previous blogposts about Musk\u2019s initial lawsuit earlier this year.\n\nMusk\u2019s latest complaint claims the case is a \u201ctextbook tale of altruism versus greed\u201d, repeating allegations in his previous suit that his former co-founders in OpenAI betrayed him by turning the company from a non-profit into a largely for-profit enterprise. \u201cThe perfidy and deceit is of Shakespearean proportions,\u201d it states.\n\nMusk\u2019s lawyer, Marc Toberoff, claimed the new lawsuit held vast differences from the case earlier this year. The latest complaint \u201cholds defendants accountable for intentional misrepresentations to Musk and the public, and seeks the disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains on a grand scale\u201d, he said.\n\nThe lawsuit renews a legal battle between Musk, the world\u2019s richest man and one of its most influential tech leaders, and Altman, who has become the face of the generative AI boom in recent years and a prominent industry figure himself. The two co-founded OpenAI in 2015 before Musk left the company over an internal power struggle several years later. As Altman\u2019s power grew, their relationship turned increasingly acrimonious.\n\nMusk\u2019s new lawsuit centers around a similar claim to the one he filed in February, arguing that Altman, his other co-founder Greg Brockman and OpenAI broke what he calls the \u201cfounding agreement\u201d to develop artificial intelligence for the betterment of humanity. The company breached that agreement as it pivoted towards a partnership with Microsoft and became largely for-profit, Musk alleges, threatening humanity with reckless advancement of AI.\n\nOpenAI and Altman vehemently pushed back against Musk\u2019s original allegations, casting him as a bitter and petty ex-partner who was jealous of the company\u2019s success after he left. In a March blogpost following the initial suit, Altman and other OpenAI executives published emails claiming to show that Musk always supported a shift toward for-profit status and stated: \u201cWe\u2019re sad that it\u2019s come to this with someone whom we\u2019ve deeply admired.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we said about Elon\u2019s initial legal filing, which was subsequently withdrawn, Elon\u2019s prior emails continue to speak for themselves,\u201d an OpenAI spokesperson told the Guardian in response to the new lawsuit.\n\nThe new complaint contains additional allegations that OpenAI broke federal racketeering laws, Musk\u2019s lawyer told the New York Times, and is \u201ca much more forceful lawsuit\u201d than the previous dropped suit. It also alleges that Altman and his associates participated in \u201cnumerous acts of wire fraud\u201d through accepting financial contributions from Musk.\n\n\u201c\u200b\u200bAfter Musk lent his name to the venture, invested significant time, tens of millions of dollars in seed capital and recruited top AI scientists for OpenAI Inc, Musk and the non-profit\u2019s namesake objective were betrayed by Altman and his accomplices,\u201d the suit states.\n\nMusk\u2019s original case against Altman and OpenAI wound through California courts for weeks and included his lawyers successfully petitioning for a change of judge, but they pulled the suit without comment one day before a San Francisco superior court judge was set to hear Altman and OpenAI\u2019s case for dismissal.\n\nMusk also founded his own rival AI company last year, called xAI, and has pursued building a similar chatbot to OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Musk\u2019s chatbot has failed to gain the popularity or partnerships with big tech companies that ChatGPT has achieved, however, and faced backlash for spreading misinformation.\n\nFive US secretaries of state announced on Monday that they planned to send a letter to Musk demanding changes to the chatbot after it promoted falsehoods about the 2024 presidential election."
