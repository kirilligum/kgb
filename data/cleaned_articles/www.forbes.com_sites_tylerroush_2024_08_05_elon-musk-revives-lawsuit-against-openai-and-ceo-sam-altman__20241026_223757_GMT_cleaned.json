    "body_text": "Elon Musk on Monday revived a lawsuit against OpenAI and its founder Sam Altman, claiming the company has prioritized the development of artificial intelligence for profit instead of the benefit of humanity, weeks after Tesla\u2019s chief executive withdrew his original suit and revitalizing a yearslong feud between Musk and the company.\n\nMusk withdrew an original lawsuit earlier this year, after claiming OpenAI and its founders were ... [+] developing AI to \u201cmaximize profits\u201d instead of benefiting humanity.\n\nIn the new complaint, Musk alleges OpenAI, Altman and co-founder Greg Brockman breached OpenAI\u2019s founding contract from 2015 by developing AI for \u201cpersonal profits,\u201d claiming Altman \u201cstands to make billions\u201d from the company, instead of for the \u201cbenefit of humanity.\u201d\n\nMusk filed a similar lawsuit in February but withdrew the suit in June, a day before a judge was scheduled to rule on whether it should be dismissed, though Musk did not explain his decision to back out.\n\nAltman and Brockman approached Musk\u2014who later agreed to help fund the project\u2014in 2015 to launch a non-profit organization to develop AI for the public good, a mission that Musk alleges the company and its founders have failed by partnering with Microsoft, according to the latest filing.\n\nMusk\u2019s lawsuit requests a jury trial and for OpenAI to pay damages that would be determined at that trial, and for a judge to fully or partially nullify OpenAI\u2019s licensing agreement with Microsoft.\n\nOpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nOpenAI responded to Musk\u2019s original lawsuit in a blog post, saying the company\u2019s mission is to ensure AI \u201cbenefits all of humanity, which means both building safe and beneficial\u201d technology and \u201chelping create broadly distributed benefits.\u201d\n\nMusk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and its founders in March, stemming from claims Musk said the company made when helping secure funding from him. OpenAI, founded as a non-profit in 2015, allegedly promised to have its technology be open-sourced to the public while also developing guardrails for AI, Musk said. OpenAI launched its for-profit arm in 2019, which it said would \u201crapidly increase our investments\u201d to help ensure AI \u201cbenefits all of humanity.\u201d Musk stepped away from OpenAI in 2018, though his filing indicates he continued contributing financially up to late 2020. OpenAI said Musk acknowledged the company\u2019s need for a for-profit arm to help secure funding, despite his criticism, while also claiming in 2017 that Musk wanted to have a majority equity in the company\u2019s for-profit arm and be its CEO. Musk has criticized OpenAI\u2019s relationship with Microsoft for years, alleging the company has prioritized profits and shareholder value over AI safety. In his original filing, Musk alleged Microsoft \u201cstands to make a fortune\u201d from selling GPT-4, the company\u2019s AI model, which would \u201cnot be possible\u201d if OpenAI made its technology available and free to the public \u201cas it is required to do so.\u201d\n\nMusk is the richest person in the world with a net worth of $226.9 billion, according to our latest estimates."
