    "body_text": "Elon Musk withdrew his lawsuit on Tuesday against OpenAI, the maker of the online chatbot ChatGPT, a day before a state judge in San Francisco was set to consider whether it should be dismissed.\n\nThe suit, filed in February, had accused the artificial intelligence start-up and two of its founders, Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, of breaching OpenAI\u2019s founding contract by prioritizing commercial interests over the public good.\n\nA multibillion-dollar partnership that OpenAI signed with Microsoft, Mr. Musk\u2019s suit claimed, represented an abandonment of the company\u2019s pledge to carefully develop A.I. and make the technology publicly available.\n\nCade Metz writes about artificial intelligence, driverless cars, robotics, virtual reality and other emerging areas of technology."
