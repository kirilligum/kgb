    "body_text": "Elon Musk has revived a lawsuit against OpenAI, the maker of the A.I. chatbot ChatGPT, refueling a six-year-old feud that began with a power struggle at the San Francisco start-up.\n\nLike the original suit, the new complaint, filed on Monday in federal court in Northern California, claims that OpenAI and two of its founders, Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, breached the company\u2019s founding contract by putting commercial interests ahead of the public good.\n\nMr. Musk withdrew his original suit seven weeks ago, without an explanation, one day before a judge was set to rule on whether it should be dismissed."
