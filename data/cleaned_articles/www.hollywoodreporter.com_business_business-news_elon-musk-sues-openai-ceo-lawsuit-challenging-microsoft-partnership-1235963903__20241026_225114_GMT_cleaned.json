    "body_text": "Elon Musk is reigniting a legal battle against OpenAI over its for-profit pivot, this time looking to void the company\u2019s partnership with Microsoft.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of California on Monday, alleges fraud and breach of contract over claims that the Tesla founder was swindled when he invested roughly $45 million into the AI venture, which he says betrayed its original mission to safely develop the technology \u201cfor the benefit of humanity.\u201d In Musk\u2019s telling, chief executive Sam Altman illegally partnered with Microsoft to establish a web of illicit affiliates and plunder its nonprofit arm of assets and staff in violation of their deal.\n\nMusk seeks a court order invalidating OpenAI\u2019s exclusive license with Microsoft giving it unique access to the underlying code of GPT-4, as well as treble damages and disgorgement of profits attributed to his investments in the company. It names Altman, president Greg Brockman and dozens of subsidiaries.\n\nIn Hollywood, utilization of AI tools in the production pipeline is positioned to be the next battleground between creators and studios. With the introduction of Sora, capable of creating hyperrealist videos with a prompt of just a couple sentences, OpenAI is courting the industry amid the rise of the technology.\n\nMarc Toberoff, a lawyer for Musk who regularly sues studios on behalf of creators to claw back the copyrights to their works, stresses that AI tools \u2014 if controlled by a handful of companies, like OpenAI and Microsoft \u2014 threatens talent. \u201cThis case is about far more than money, the future of AGI lies in the balance,\u201d he says.\n\nAI is increasingly being adopted in concept art, visual effects and postproduction amid belt-tightening, displacing some workers.\n\nMusk\u2019s ties to OpenAI can be traced back to 2015, when he cofounded the company among a group of other prominent Silicon Valley investors. The lawsuit points to messages from Altman as proof that he defrauded Musk, who was told in an email, \u201cThe technology would be owned by the foundation and used \u2018for the good of the world.'\u201d\n\nPer its certificate of incorporation, a legal document relating to the formation of a company, OpenAI said it \u201cwill seek to open source technology for the public benefit.\u201d It adds that that company will \u201cnot be organized for the private gain of any one person\u201d and that \u201cno part of the net income or assets of this corporation shall ever inure to the benefit of any director, officer or member.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit details Microsoft\u2019s early courtship of OpenAI while Musk was still with the company. In 2016, the Satya Nadella-led firm offered to sell \u201cCompute\u201d to the company at a steep discount if it\u2019d agree to publicly promote Microsoft\u2019s products, according to the complaint.\n\n\u201cThis actually made me feel nauseous,\u201d he wrote to Altman, the lawsuit states. \u201cIt sucks and is exactly what I would expect from them.\u201d\n\nLater that year, the two companies announced a partnership giving OpenAI access to Microsoft\u2019s latest technology for running large-scale AI training.\n\nBut after he left the board in 2018 due to a potential conflict of interest with Tesla, which he owns and was ramping up its focus on AI, Musk claims Altman directed the company to form numerous for-profit entities. This includes OpenAI, L.P., which was established as a \u201ccapped-profit company.\u201d\n\nAnd with the creation of a for-profit arm, Altman allegedly transferred the nonprofit division\u2019s staff and assets to the new company. OpenAI\u2019s dozens of other affiliates were woven into its \u201ccorporate web for the purpose of profiting from the nonprofit\u2019s assets\u201d as part of a \u201cshell game,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\n\u201cJust follow the money,\u201d states the complaint. \u201cThe nonprofit\u2019s 2022 IRS tax return showed just $44,485.00 in revenue, but one year later, OpenAI overall reportedly generated hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201d\n\nMusk also alleges that Altman withheld and misrepresented information to the board, going as far as to lie in some business dealings. In discussions with the nonprofit, he allegedly claimed to be an independent board member of OpenAI Startup Fund while omitting that he owns the company. Other instances of alleged self-dealing include OpenAI\u2019s partnership with Reddit in a deal in which the social media platform\u2019s content can be shown on ChatGPT, as well as a $51 million chip deal with Rain, another company in which he\u2019s a significant shareholder, according to the complaint.\n\n\u201cAnd currently, on information and belief, OpenAI is hammering out a deal with Helion Energy (in which Altman owns a massive stake) for [it] to buy vast quantities of electricity to power its data centers,\u201d the lawsuit states.\n\nOn \u201cThe TED AI Show\u201d podcast, former OpenAI board member Helen Toner, who was a part of ousting Altman in November before he was reinstated, said: \u201cSam had made it really difficult for the board to\u201d fulfill its mission to safely develop the technology by \u201cin some cases, outright lying.\u201d The lawsuit claims Musk seized control of the company\u2019s board alongside Microsoft to further undermine safety guardrails, with the goal of maximizing profits.\n\nThe filing of the complaint follows Musk in June dropping a similar lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman without explanation. He\u2019s openly criticized the company for abandoning its original structure.\n\nLast year, Musk founded xAI, which has since reached a valuation of $24 billion.\n\nMusk is represented by Toberoff, widely considered among the entertainment industry\u2019s preeminent copyright termination lawyers. He\u2019s brought lawsuits on behalf of the estate of Steve Ditko, who co-created Spider-Man and Doctor Strange, the heirs to the writer of the magazine story that spawned Top Gun and Lance Hill, who wrote the screenplay for Road House."
