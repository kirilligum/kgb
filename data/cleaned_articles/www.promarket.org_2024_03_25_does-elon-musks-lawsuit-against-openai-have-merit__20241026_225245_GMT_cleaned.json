    "body_text": "Two professors of law assess the merits and questions raised by Musk\u2019s recent lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman.\n\nElon Musk is suing OpenAI and its directors for, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty. The alleged breach consists essentially of allowing the use of OpenAI\u2019s assets (including funds donated by Musk) for pursuit of private, for-profit purposes rather than the charitable nonprofit ones for which OpenAI was founded. OpenAI describes itself as a \u201cnonprofit\u201d with a \u201cgoal [] to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole.\u201d Musk\u2019s complaint argues its operation of an artificial intelligence system (GPT-4) behind a paywall, plans to license future AI technology to Microsoft, and provision of a board observer seat to Microsoft betray this nonprofit mission.\n\nMusk\u2019s claim may or may not be right. But he is surely the wrong person to bring it. The problem is it\u2019s unclear whether anyone else will.\n\nLike OpenAI, nonprofit organizations often take corporate legal forms. This makes it easy for those steeped in for-profit corporate law to assume disgruntled donors or supporters can\u2014like unhappy shareholders\u2014sue to challenge the actions of their fiduciaries. They cannot. Standing to challenge nonprofit fiduciaries\u2019 compliance with their duties is instead typically limited only to fellow fiduciaries and the state attorney general. Elon Musk is neither.\n\nHe is, of course, a large donor. But once gifts have been made, donated assets are no longer donors\u2019 property, and they lose the authority to sue to protect them. Unless a gift instrument provides for donor standing to challenge its use, typically donors must rely on a charity\u2019s fiduciaries and the state attorney general for enforcement. Even contractual standing rights will not entitle donors to challenge a nonprofit\u2019s compliance with its overall mission, as even substantial donations do not make donors the arbiter of a nonprofit\u2019s purpose.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, standing to sue nonprofit leaders is actually limited in order to protect their missions, which are myriad and sometimes divisive. Endowing contributors or the public at large with standing would subject controversial nonprofits to potentially draining nuisance suits. Competitors could use fiduciary challenges to wrest value from nonprofit entities to the ultimate detriment of their charitable missions. Filling the seats of nonprofit boards with dedicated and expert directors would become even more challenging.\n\nThese well-intentioned standing limits make enforcement by the state attorney general all the more critical; but here, as too often, it may not be up to the task. OpenAI created an organizational structure designed to ensure its nonprofit mission remains paramount, but its directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 actions in commercializing its technology may have crossed the line. If so, attorney-general enforcement is appropriate and warranted. But attorneys general are notoriously under-resourced and this suit would take on a massive and contentious industry with the potential to infuriate multiple tech billionaires. Will even an attorney general with grave concerns choose to absorb the litigation costs and political fallout from a suit against OpenAI\u2019s leaders? This potential vacuum \u2013 even when billions in charitable assets are at risk \u2013 reveals afresh the risks of underenforcement in the nonprofit sector and the need for creative solutions.\n\nAccording to Elon Musk, the fate of humanity may depend on the resolution of his lawsuit, filed earlier in March, against Sam Altman and the company Altman co-founded and runs, OpenAI. Musk claims the lawsuit is designed to ensure that artificial intelligence benefits humanity, rather than becoming \u201csuper-intelligent, surpass[ing] human intelligence, and threaten[ing] humanity.\u201d\n\nMusk argues that Altman and OpenAI betrayed OpenAI\u2019s founding raison d\u2019etre to be the anti-Google, or \u201cthe opposite of Google,\u201d as Musk\u2019s complaint describes. OpenAI\u2019s technology would benefit humanity, rather than benefitting a few rich people. OpenAI\u2019s 2018 charter declares that \u201c[o]ur primary fiduciary duty is to humanity.\u201d\n\nMusk\u2019s claims for breach and false promises revolve around two central moves by OpenAI\u2014the decision to partner with Microsoft allegedly undermining OpenAI\u2019s public benefit, and the refusal to make public more information about its latest advances.\n\nThe central difficulty for Musk is that the language of OpenAI\u2019s commitments are, excuse the pun, open-ended.\n\nMusk notes that the 2015 Certificate of Incorporation requires OpenAI to \u201cbenefit the public.\u201d However, Altman can certainly argue that the free public access to ChatGPT 3.5 evidences OpenAI\u2019s public benefit. After all, millions of people across the world are using OpenAI\u2019s free services. The founding documents do not commit OpenAI to benefit the public with every activity. Even a not-for-profit can sell goods or services in order to raise funds for its operations. Unless Musk or some other benefactor had been willing to give orders of magnitude more funds to OpenAI, its efforts to advance AI would need another funding source. Its deal with Microsoft is seen as providing crucial advantages to both companies\u2014for OpenAI, the computing resources to develop its models, and for Microsoft, access to advanced AI models that it could use in future products.\n\nMusk\u2019s second complaint is about OpenAI\u2019s lack of, as it were, openness. (Musk even suggested that if OpenAI changed its name to ClosedAI, he would drop the suit.) OpenAI has in fact become less and less open, providing less information about its AI models as they have advanced. OpenAI\u2019s 2015 Certificate of Incorporation, however, only declared that \u201cthe corporation will seek to open source technology for the public benefit when applicable.\u201d This loose commitment is not particularly demanding. Moreover, it is certainly plausible that Altman and OpenAI may have drawn the curtains around their most advanced technology in part to avoid that technology falling into the wrong hands.\n\nMusk faces a number of hurdles in his lawsuit, not least his own statements and actions during the course of his relationship with OpenAI. But the central premise of his lawsuit is itself fairly weak.\n\nHumanity\u2019s fate will likely not be decided with this suit.\n\nArticles represent the opinions of their writers, not necessarily those of the University of Chicago, the Booth School of Business, or its faculty."
