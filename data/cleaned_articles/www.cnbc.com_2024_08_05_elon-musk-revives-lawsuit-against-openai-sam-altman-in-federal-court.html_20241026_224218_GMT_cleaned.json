Musk states in the latest lawsuit, filed in a district court in Northern California, that he was “manipulated” into co-founding OpenAI by Altman and Brockman, who allegedly promised “that it would chart a safer, more open course than profit-driven tech giants.”\n\n“Altman assured Musk that the non-profit structure guaranteed neutrality and a focus on safety and openness for the benefit of humanity, not shareholder value. But as it turns out, this was all hot-air philanthropy—the hook for Altman’s long con,” the lawsuit claims.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson pointed CNBC to a blog post after Musk’s initial lawsuit in March.\n\n“As we said about Elon’s initial legal filing, which was subsequently withdrawn, Elon’s prior emails continue to speak for themselves,” the spokesperson said.\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment on this story. Tesla did not respond to CNBC’s request for comment.\n\nIdentifying OpenAI as a nonprofit with no shareholders, the lawsuit states that Microsoft “sought to obtain leverage in other ways by, for example, enticing OpenAI, Inc. to use and become inextricably dependent on Microsoft’s cloud computing system.”\n\n“While Musk expressed a liking for Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella … the values of the company and OpenAI, Inc. did not align,” the lawsuit claims.\n\nMicrosoft is the biggest investor in OpenAI and has poured a reported $13 billion into the company.\n\n“Over the course of the next few years and continuing to today, Microsoft methodically entrenched itself further into OpenAI,” the lawsuit alleges.\n\n— CNBC’s Jordan Novet contributed to this report."
