Musk states in the latest lawsuit, filed in a district court in Northern California, that he was \u201cmanipulated\u201d into co-founding OpenAI by Altman and Brockman, who allegedly promised \u201cthat it would chart a safer, more open course than profit-driven tech giants.\u201d\n\n\u201cAltman assured Musk that the non-profit structure guaranteed neutrality and a focus on safety and openness for the benefit of humanity, not shareholder value. But as it turns out, this was all hot-air philanthropy\u2014the hook for Altman\u2019s long con,\u201d the lawsuit claims.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson pointed CNBC to a blog post after Musk\u2019s initial lawsuit in March.\n\n\u201cAs we said about Elon\u2019s initial legal filing, which was subsequently withdrawn, Elon\u2019s prior emails continue to speak for themselves,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment on this story. Tesla did not respond to CNBC\u2019s request for comment.\n\nIdentifying OpenAI as a nonprofit with no shareholders, the lawsuit states that Microsoft \u201csought to obtain leverage in other ways by, for example, enticing OpenAI, Inc. to use and become inextricably dependent on Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing system.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile Musk expressed a liking for Microsoft\u2019s CEO Satya Nadella \u2026 the values of the company and OpenAI, Inc. did not align,\u201d the lawsuit claims.\n\nMicrosoft is the biggest investor in OpenAI and has poured a reported $13 billion into the company.\n\n\u201cOver the course of the next few years and continuing to today, Microsoft methodically entrenched itself further into OpenAI,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.\n\n\u2014 CNBC\u2019s Jordan Novet contributed to this report."
